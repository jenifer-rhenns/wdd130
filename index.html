                <p> Hello, My name is Jenifer Rhenns and I am from Brazil, the State of Santa Catarina, which we kindly call: the holy and beautiful Catarina. 
                     We have a lot of beautiful nature, hills, beaches, cold and hot. It is a good place to live.
                     I'm 35 years old,  married for 16, and have two sons, Davi is 13, and Noah 9 years old. 
                     I like to travel, know new places and people, I love nature and hiking, and I go to the gym too, but only because it's necessary to be healthy, but I don't like it a lot.
                     I like to learn new things and be useful. I like technology and design. I like movies and series too.
                     I work with little kids, but I want to change my career to have more liberty in economic, geographic, and time. </p>

        <p>Santa Catarina, located in southern Brazil, is bordered by Paraná to the north and Rio Grande do Sul to the south. 
            To the east, the state is flanked by the Atlantic Ocean, showcasing its renowned beaches and coastal landscapes. 
            To the west, Santa Catarina shares a border with the country of Paraguay, adding to its strategic and cultural diversity. 
            Inland, the state features diverse geography, including mountainous areas and the impressive Canyons Region. 
            The cultural heritage of Santa Catarina is enriched by European immigrants, particularly Germans, who have contributed significantly
            to local traditions, architecture, and festivals. This blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and geographic diversity makes 
            Santa Catarina a unique and multifaceted region within Brazil.</p>
