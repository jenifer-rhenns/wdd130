            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>RaftLife, founded in 1985 by adventurous siblings Jack and Laura Thompson,
                 began as a small family business offering white water rafting tours on the 
                 roaring rivers of Colorado. With a deep passion for the outdoors and a commitment
                  to safety and environmental stewardship, RaftLife quickly gained a reputation
                   for providing exhilarating and memorable experiences. Over the years, 
                   the company expanded its operations, adding new locations across the 
                   United States and incorporating a variety of adventure packages. 
                   Today, RaftLife is a leading name in the white water rafting industry,
                    known for its expert guides, top-notch equipment, and dedication 
                    to preserving the natural beauty of America's rivers.
